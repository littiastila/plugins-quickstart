# Architectural Acoustics by M. David Egan: A Classic Book for Sound Engineers
 
Architectural acoustics is the science and engineering of achieving a good sound within a building. It is a branch of acoustical engineering that deals with the design, construction, and evaluation of spaces for optimal sound quality and performance. Whether it is a concert hall, a classroom, a recording studio, or a home theater, architectural acoustics plays a crucial role in creating a comfortable and enjoyable acoustic environment.

One of the most influential and comprehensive books on this topic is **Architectural Acoustics** by M. David Egan. First published in 1988, this book covers the fundamental principles and practical applications of architectural acoustics in a clear and accessible way. It provides readers with a solid foundation of acoustical theory, as well as practical examples and case studies of real-world projects. It also includes hundreds of illustrations, diagrams, tables, and charts that help explain complex concepts and calculations.
 
M. David Egan is a renowned acoustical consultant and professor emeritus of architectural engineering at Clemson University. He has over 40 years of experience in teaching and consulting on architectural acoustics, noise control, and sound system design. He is also the author of several other books on acoustics, such as **Concepts in Architectural Acoustics**, **The Architectural Acoustics Primer**, and **Acoustics in Educational Settings**.

In this article, we will review some of the main topics and concepts covered in **Architectural Acoustics** by M. David Egan. We will also highlight some of the key features and benefits of this book for anyone who wants to learn more about the art and science of sound in buildings.
 
## What is Architectural Acoustics?
 
Architectural acoustics is the study of how sound behaves in enclosed spaces. It involves understanding the physical properties of sound waves, such as frequency, wavelength, amplitude, and speed, as well as how they interact with different materials and surfaces, such as walls, floors, ceilings, windows, doors, and furnishings. It also involves measuring and evaluating the acoustic quality of a space, using criteria such as reverberation time, sound pressure level, speech intelligibility, background noise, and sound isolation.
 
The goal of architectural acoustics is to design spaces that meet the specific acoustic needs and preferences of the intended users and activities. For example, a concert hall should have a long reverberation time to enhance the richness and fullness of music, while a classroom should have a short reverberation time to improve the clarity and intelligibility of speech. A recording studio should have a high level of sound isolation to prevent unwanted noise from entering or leaving the room, while a home theater should have a low level of sound isolation to allow the sound to be heard throughout the house.
 
## What are the Main Topics Covered in Architectural Acoustics?
 
**Architectural Acoustics** by M. David Egan covers a wide range of topics and concepts related to architectural acoustics. The book is divided into four parts:
 
- Part I: Fundamentals of Sound. This part introduces the basic principles and terminology of acoustics, such as sound waves, sound pressure, sound power, sound intensity, decibels, frequency spectrum, octave bands, weighting networks, and psychoacoustics.
- Part II: Sound in Enclosed Spaces. This part explains how sound behaves in rooms and halls, such as reflection, absorption, diffusion, scattering, diffraction, interference, standing waves, modes, resonance, reverberation, and Sabine's formula.
- Part III: Sound Isolation. This part describes how sound is transmitted through partitions and openings, such as airborne sound transmission loss (TL), impact sound transmission loss (ITL), flanking transmission (FT), noise reduction (NR), noise criteria (NC), room criteria (RC), and sound transmission class (STC).
- Part IV: Sound Systems. This part discusses how sound is reproduced and reinforced by electronic devices and systems, such as microphones, loudspeakers, amplifiers, mixers, equalizers, filters, compressors, limiters, reverberators, delays, feedback control systems (FCS), public address systems (PA), distributed loudspeaker systems (DLS), and sound reinforcement systems (SRS).
